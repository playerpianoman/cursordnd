### Round summary (state)
STATE | Goblin alarm: 4/4 | Rats swarm: 0/4 | Torch dwindles: 0/6 | Stress 0/3 | Supply 3/3 | Harm: none | goblins: 4 | Fighter stress 1/3 | Rogue stress 0/3 | Mage stress 0/3 | Location: The Old Drain | The goblins are alerted and prepare for a fight as the rogue's attempt to scout or disable the gate has drawn their attention. The party stands at the mouth of a damp tunnel at the edge of the Old Drain, with rats scuttling in the walls. Ahead, a rusted gate remains, and the sound of goblin voices increases. The Mage's spell failed, and the goblins are now more prepared.
