- Why are goblins using the Old Drain?
- What are the goblins guarding or moving through here?
- Is there a side access (overflow slit, maintenance rung, cracked brick) to flank the choke point?
- What is beyond the bend—what are the goblins guarding or moving through here beyond the choke point?
- Is there a usable side recess or maintenance rung beyond the choke point?
- Can you exploit a side recess to buy a momentary stand or create a misdirection for the goblins?
- Can you use the dead rat as a decoy to misdirect pursuing goblins, given the trail of blood and scent?
- Can you exploit a side recess beyond the choke point to slip away unseen when the goblins are concentrated at the bend?
- How do you avoid being pinned now that the goblins are on full alert?
