- Player: I grip the hooked pole in both hands, brace the grate with it to keep it from biting back, and sprint into the deeper dark. I bend low, hug the left wall, and drive toward the tunnel bend where the floor dips and narrows, hoping the distance and the slope slow the goblins enough for a chance to slip past the pursuers. I keep the pole ready to jab or block if one closes, and I’ll press into any side recess or crack I can find as soon as the light and chase allow.
